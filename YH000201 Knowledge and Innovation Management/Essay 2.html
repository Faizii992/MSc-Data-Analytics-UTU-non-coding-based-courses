<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;"></p><p dir="ltr">Numerous organizations face the problem of unsatisfactory work conditions which causes tremendous motivation issues. For companies that employ crowdsourcing strategies, this situation is even more grave. In 2019, thousands of Uber drivers worldwide protested for improved working conditions and demanded increased compensation, greater openness about the methodology used by the app to determine their rates, perks including health and disability insurance, and more influence over business regulations pertaining to their working circumstances. These upgrades are long overdue, according to drivers. <strong>(Gaffary, 2019)</strong> However, many drivers claim that over time, the situation has gotten much worse, despite the disagreeable adjustments and insignificant benefits brought about by Uber, they pale in comparison to the anticipated earnings and working situation of Uber's staff.</p><p dir="ltr">Uber is an example of a ridesharing application that crowdsource labor. This concept and Uber’s issue falls under the topic of “Issues of Crowdsourcing” as it refers to motivation issues in crowdsourcing which is the main theme of the problem mentioned above. Generally, the act of a firm or organization adopting a function that was previously handled by workers and outsourcing it to an unspecified (and often huge) network of individuals via an open call is referred to as crowdsourcing <strong>(Vanarasi 2020).</strong> This can take the form of peer-production (where the task is done jointly), but it is also frequently done by lone persons (experts or beginners) <strong>(Hossain, 2015), (Howe, 2010).</strong> Uber implements crowdsourcing by utilizing lone drivers and their vehicles to serve clients in need. <br></p><p dir="ltr">In light of past issues and driver dissatisfaction within crowdsourcing platforms like Uber, it's crucial to address these motivation issues. Organizations should ensure fare changes are transparent, fair, and based on a well-defined criteria and provide a minimum hourly wage or guarantee to give drivers a sense of income stability. They should implement a minimum earnings guarantee and reduce the financial stress that has demotivated drivers. Reward programs can offer tangible incentives, benefits, bonuses, and recognition for excellent performance, improving motivation and job satisfaction. Greater flexibility in scheduling and support for drivers' diverse needs can help to maintain driver commitment. Uber can increase job happiness, retention, and the caliber of service it offers customers by putting these suggestions into practice while taking into account previous problems and fostering a more encouraging and supportive work environment for its drivers.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong><u>References</u></strong>:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Shirin Ghaffary (2019).
