By disclosing the operating or trade secrets of such organizations, an organization's functionality and growth can seriously be hindered. Due to security issues when it comes to their sensitive information, many businesses deal with this problem and its consequences. For instance, Tesla has filed lawsuits against former employees who left the company to work for rival companies or their own startup, alleging that they stole trade secrets and source code and violate</span>d intellectual property rights(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/neal-e-boudette">Boudette</a>, 2022). This legal dispute brought to light the difficulties of safeguarding intellectual property in the fiercely competitive autonomous driving industry.<br></p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;The problem stated above falls under the concept of knowledge leakage discussed in Lecture 3, which refers to vital organizational knowledge that leaves a secure environment and is transferred or released to another environment where that knowledge can be applied either in the same way or in new competitive ways that are detrimental to the organization from which the knowledge originated (Ahmad et al. 2014). The leakage occurs through employees, external collaboration and accidents. In the aforementioned scenario, it occurred through an employee. This happens due to a faulty security culture and lack of comprehensive plan tailored to an organization’s needs.</p><br><p dir="ltr">Based on these notions, the organizations should impose stringent access controls and only allow workers access to the areas of the source code that are essential for their duties. Source code repositories should be secured with strong authentication and authorisation procedures (Altukruni et al. 2021), and tight monitoring and audits to track accesses and actions. All employees, particularly those with source code access(Le et al. 2014) should be subjected to comprehensive background checks to ensure their dependability, and they should be compelled to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that bind them to maintain the confidentiality of your source code. Working with legal advice can also assist with legal steps and remedies in the event of a breach. Workers or contractors who break confidentiality agreements and leak source code should face legal penalties.</p><br><p dir="ltr">References:&nbsp;</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Ahmad, A., Bosua, R., &amp; Scheepers, R.
